                        DAILY! Worldwide there are more than 60 billion animals kept for the food industry, on an unprecedented 
                        scale which will only continue to increase by one still growing world population.</p>

                        <p class="light flow-text">In the Netherlands 40% of the total climate load is caused by the animal food industry.
                        Worldwide this is about 20% which makes this a greater polluter than the whole transport sector with all
                        its aircraft and oil tankers. It is simply bizarre how much water and food must be produced to feed a cow 
                        to ultimately achieve 1 kg of meat. Many meat eaters say the soybean industry is so bad for the environment, 
                        and yes that's right. However, more needs to be done when 75% of all soy nutrition goes to the animal industry. 
                        The result is one enormous attack on nature, acidification from farmland by the huge amounts of manure and 
                        massive deforestation.</p>

                        <p class="light flow-text">Everything seems to indicate that one plant-based diet is many times healthier for us than an 
                        animal-based diet with proteins and fats. What a recognized fact is that processed meat like ham, salami, 
                        burgers and sausages, is carcinogenic and in the same WHO category such as smoking and asbestos. Also eating a 
                        lot of meat ensures more fat deposits in the blood vessels (cholesterol) which later in life can lead to various
                        heart and vascular disease. I think that many of us are ready are for the next step. I like the concept of 
                        flexitarian whereas at least three vegan days a week must be completed. So no meat, no fish and no dairy, from 
                        breakfast until dinner, a completely vegetable day. </p>
